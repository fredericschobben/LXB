LXB Water Quality

Hi, as a student in urban design and spatial planning I'm getting at my way in desgining maps. 
I want to design a map that people can use for checking out their water quality.
Using mobile gps, a phone, and a diy toolkit for water analysis...
I want to gather the information of many peoples their own tested chemical and biological water values.
The location and scale of the project is the water surfaces in the country of luxembourg. 
I want to relate these on-the-ground information to digital knowledge. 
And create awareness around these rivers.
The purpose is to detect the waterquality that is suitable for swimming.
Later on we can suggest outdoor swimming and maybe also urban outdoor swimming.
Creating new public places in the city were people can go swimming for free.
